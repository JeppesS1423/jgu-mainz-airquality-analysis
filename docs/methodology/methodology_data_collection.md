# Methodology: Data Collection and Processing

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used for collecting and processing air quality data from sensor.community for our research project at Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz. The process involved web scraping, data validation, and targeted data retrieval for missing information.

## Data Source

The primary data source for this project is [sensor.community](https://sensor.community/), a global sensor network for citizen science environmental monitoring. This platform provides air quality data from various sensors located in Mainz and surrounding areas.

## Web Scraping Process

### Initial Scraping Attempt

1. **Web Scraper Development**: 
   - I developed a custom web scraper using Python to automatically collect data from the sensor.community website.
   - The scraper was designed to navigate through the site and download CSV files containing daily sensor readings.

2. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Before initiating the scraping process, I checked for the presence of a robots.txt file on the sensor.community website to ensure compliance with any scraping policies.
   - I found that the website did not have a robots.txt file or any explicit information regarding scraping policies.
   - Despite the absence of explicit restrictions, I implemented measures to ensure our scraping activities would not overload the server, including appropriate time delays between requests.

3. **Initial Results**:
   - The initial scraping attempt successfully retrieved a significant portion of the required data.
   - However, I noticed gaps in the collected data, indicating that the scraper was unable to retrieve all the files for various reasons.

### Addressing Data Gaps

1. **Gap Analysis**:
   - I developed a script to analyze the collected data and identify missing dates.
   - This analysis revealed specific dates for which data was not successfully retrieved during the initial scraping process.

2. **Targeted Scraper Development**:
   - Based on the gap analysis, I created a targeted scraper specifically designed to retrieve data for the missing dates.
   - This scraper was more focused and efficient, as it only needed to access specific URLs for the missing data.

3. **Execution of Targeted Scraping**:
   - I ran the targeted scraper to fill in the gaps in our dataset.
   - This process significantly improved the completeness of our data collection.

## Data Validation and Cleaning

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - After the targeted scraping, I performed a thorough check to ensure we had data for all available dates within our study period.
   - I discovered that some sensors did not have data for certain dates. This could be due to sensor malfunctions, maintenance, or other factors affecting data collection at the source.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - I implemented checks to verify the integrity of the downloaded files, ensuring they were not corrupted during the download process.

3. **Format Consistency**:
   - I standardized the format of all collected data to ensure consistency across different dates and sensors.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Incomplete Initial Scraping**:
   - Challenge: The initial scraper couldn't retrieve all files.
   - Solution: Developed a gap analysis script and a targeted scraper to retrieve missing data.

2. **Missing Data for Some Sensors**:
   - Challenge: Some sensors had no data for certain dates.
   - Solution: We documented these gaps and considered them in our analysis, ensuring our findings accounted for this limitation in data availability.

3. **Ethical Scraping**:
   - Challenge: Lack of explicit scraping guidelines on the website.
   - Solution: Implemented responsible scraping practices, including rate limiting and server-friendly access patterns.

## Conclusion

My data collection methodology evolved in response to challenges encountered during the initial scraping process. By implementing a two-phase approach with an initial broad scrape followed by targeted data retrieval, I were able to compile a comprehensive dataset for my air quality analysis. The process highlighted the importance of flexible and adaptive data collection strategies in real-world research scenarios.
